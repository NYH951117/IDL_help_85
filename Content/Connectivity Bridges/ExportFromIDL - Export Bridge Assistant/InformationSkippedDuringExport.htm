        <h1><a name="Information_Skipped_During_Export"></a><a name="kanchor5271"></a>Information Skipped During Export</h1>
        <p>The Assistant skips certain information when creating an object specification for exporting because such information is unnecessary or unavailable for a wrapper object.</p>
        <h2><a name="kanchor5272"></a>Lifecycle Methods</h2>
        <p>The lifecycle methods of the IDL source object, Init and Cleanup, are not presented in the list of methods to export in the Assistant. These methods are called through the bridge when the wrapper object stock methods createObject and destroyObject are called. (Note that Java capitalization is used here, COM names are different.) It is not useful to export a wrapper method explicitly for either of these routines.</p>
        <p>For information on the stock methods, see <a href="../ExportFromIDL - COM Objects/StockCOMWrapperMethods.htm#Stock_COM_Wrapper_Methods">Stock COM Wrapper Methods</a> and <a href="../ExportFromIDL - Java Objects/StockJavaWrapperMethods.htm#Stock_Java_Wrapper_Methods">Stock Java Wrapper Methods</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="kanchor5273"></a>Get Property and <a name="kanchor5274"></a>Set Property Methods</h2>
        <p>The GetProperty and SetProperty methods of the IDL source object are not presented in the list of methods to export in the Assistant. These methods will be called through the Export Bridge when the wrapper object routines for setting or retrieving a specific property are called. It is not useful to export a wrapper method explicitly for either of these routines.</p>
        <h2><a name="Drawable_Object_Event_Handlers"></a><a name="kanchor5275"></a>Drawable Object <a name="kanchor5276"></a>Event Handlers</h2>
        <p>For drawable objects (objects subclassed from IDLitWindow, IDLgrWindow, or IDLitDirectWindow) as well as IDLitDirectWindow superclass itself, the following methods are not typically needed in the exported object:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">OnEnter</li>
            <li value="2"> OnExit</li>
            <li value="3"> OnExpose</li>
            <li value="4">OnKeyboard</li>
            <li value="5">OnMouseDown</li>
            <li value="6"> OnMouseMotion</li>
            <li value="7">OnMouseUp</li>
            <li value="8">OnResize</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default these methods are not presented in the Assistant for export from either the original IDL source object or its superclasses.</p>
        <p>These routines in the source object are called directly by the Export Bridge when events are being handled, and so they are typically not needed in the exported object.</p>
        <p>Exporting these routines would be unnecessary and confusing to most users since they might assume that the methods in the exported object would be called, but under default conditions they are unused. The sophisticated user might actually want to call these in the client application, however, and so they can be presented in the assistant by starting the application with the DRAWABLE_EVENTHANDLERS keyword set (in addition to the OBJECT_FILE keyword). See <a href="RunningTheAssistant.htm#Running_The_Assistant">Running the Assistant</a> for details.</p>
        <p>Typically, the methods found in .pro code object definition files will appear in the Export Bridge Assistant. Since IDLgrWindow and IDLitWindow object definition files are built-in, they do not appear as superclasses and their methods are not presented in the Assistant.</p>
